## Questions

1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

## Answers

1. I think that getting to learn about PRS in general are really cool since they're on the cutting edge of bioinformatics. Beyond that I also learning about the different techniques that cotnribute to the process like a GWAS and an QTL analysis. I didn't realize all the steps involved and learning about them has been really cool.
2. I think an interesting place to investigate is the pruning step specifically of the PRS process. This is a step that I found myself lumping together a lot with thresholding, but I'm curious if there's different methods for pruning and perhaps machine learning might be able to tell us something about clusters of QTLs that previous PCA or other methods had missed.
3. I wish I had taken a little bit more of a communivative approach with the other members of the team. I think that could of saved me a lot of time and rather than all of us individually writing the same code we could focus our efforts on actual progress and new ideas.
4. I think it's hard to use different techniques since the data demands are so great, but it would cool if we could add some form of machine learning or multithreading to either reveal QTLs that we hadn't previously identified or just to rapidly spead up the process.
